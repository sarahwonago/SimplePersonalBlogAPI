# Simple Personal Blog API
This Simple Personal Blog backend API is built using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF) that powers a personal blogging platform. The API allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve blog articles. Users can also filter articles based on tags or publication status. This API can be consumed by frontend applications like React, mobile apps, or other clients that need a blog feature.

**Features**
## What the Project Does:
1. Authentication: The project includes user authentication using JWT authentication.
2. List Articles: Retrieve a list of all published/unpublished articles.
3. Filter Articles: Apply filters by tags and publication status.
4. Create New Articles: Authenticated users can create and publish new articles.
5. View a Single Article: Retrieve details of a specific article by its ID.
6. Update Articles: Authenticated users can update the content or metadata of existing articles by specifying the article ID.
