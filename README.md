# Simple Personal Blog API with JWT Authentication
This Simple Personal Blog backend API is built using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF) that powers a personal blogging platform. The API allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve blog articles. Users can also filter articles based on tags or publication status. This API can be consumed by frontend applications like React, mobile apps, or other clients that need a blog feature.


**Features**
- **User Registration**: Users can register with their email, username, and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticated users can log in and receive access and refresh tokens.
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Protects routes using JWT tokens (access and refresh tokens).
- **Article Management**: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete articles.
- **Token Blacklisting**: (Optional) Allows for revoking JWT tokens.
- **Swagger Documentation**: API documentation available via Swagger UI.


## What the Project Does:
1. Authentication- Allows users to register and authenticate via JWT tokens.Supports token refresh and (optionally) token blacklisting.
2. List Articles: Retrieve a list of all published/unpublished articles.
3. Filter Articles: Apply filters by tags and publication status.
4. Create New Articles: Authenticated users can create and publish new articles.
5. View a Single Article: Retrieve details of a specific article by its ID.
6. Update Articles: Authenticated users can update the content or metadata of existing articles by specifying the article ID.
7. Delete Articles: Authenticated users can delete an article by its ID.
8. Comment on articles
9. Share articles
10. Like articles

## What the Project Does Not Do:
1. No Frontend: This project is a backend API only. It does not include a frontend for interacting with the articles (e.g., no HTML views, no JavaScript).
2. This API does not handle OAuth2 or third-party login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
3. It does not encrypt the JWT token payload.
